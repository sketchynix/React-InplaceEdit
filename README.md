# React-InplaceEdit
This is a component to allow for a user to edit a piece on content in place, by clicking on it.
Very similar in concept to contenteditable, except with permissions, save/cancel buttons, and a draft of the edit.

There is a bunch of boilerplate from a yeoman generator that I need to remove.
